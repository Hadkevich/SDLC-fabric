# Agentic SDLC — Project Instructions

## 📍 Auditing this repo or collecting project data? Read these, in order
This project is the hackathon deliverable for an *Agent-Driven SDLC & Software Factory*.
Everything a grader needs is mapped explicitly — do not guess, follow the map:

1. **[`REQUIREMENTS-TRACEABILITY.md`](REQUIREMENTS-TRACEABILITY.md)** — **start here.** Every hackathon + Task-04 requirement → the exact file that satisfies it, with honest ✅/🟡/❌ status.
2. **[`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md)** — authoritative Agentic SDLC spec: lifecycle (§3, 9 stages incl. `e2e_validation`), agent roles (§4, 9 agents), communication protocol (§5), artifact standards (§6), governance (§9).
3. **[`ARCHITECTURE-DIAGRAM.md`](ARCHITECTURE-DIAGRAM.md)** — agent-ecosystem + engine + gate diagrams (Mermaid).
4. **[`EVALUATION.md`](EVALUATION.md)** — what worked / what failed on the real `neural-sync` run (honest; the run completes end-to-end — the review gate caught BLK-001, it was fixed, and deployment passed; `e2e_validation` is implemented but not yet exercised on the demo).
5. **[`docs/requirements/`](docs/requirements/)** — the source-of-truth requirements this repo is graded against (verbatim).
6. **[`projects/neural-sync/`](projects/neural-sync/)** — the demo app the pipeline built ([README](projects/neural-sync/README.md)).
7. **[`COST-EFFICIENCY.md`](COST-EFFICIENCY.md)** — scorecard §7: per-role cost report (`--cost-report` → `cost_report.{json,md}`), model routing (opus/sonnet/haiku), and the live model A/B.

Code map: deterministic engine → `src/orchestrator/` · subagents → `.claude/agents/`
(product, planner, architect, developer, reviewer, qa, devops, **e2e**, orchestrator) ·
artifact schemas → `schemas/` · tests → `tests/` · live dashboard → `observability/`.

## Goal
Deliver small real software projects end-to-end using a multi-agent pipeline with deterministic handoffs and machine-readable artifacts.

## Rules
- Follow the spec in `SPEC.md` exactly.
- Produce structured JSON artifacts — never substitute prose for a required JSON file.
- Do not change requirements without explicit product-agent output.
- Do not write code before architecture artifacts exist.
- Always run tests before marking any stage complete.
- Log every stage transition as an event in `events.log.jsonl`.
- Each agent writes only the artifacts assigned to its stage — no cross-stage writes.
- Escalate on ambiguity, repeated failures (> max_retries), or unsafe requests.

## Project layout
Every project is self-contained under `projects/<project-name>/`:
```
projects/<project-name>/
  artifacts/          ← all pipeline JSON artifacts + events.log.jsonl
    adr/
  <source files>      ← actual code produced by developer-agent
  tests/              ← tests produced by qa-agent
```
Global example/reference artifacts stay in the root `artifacts/` folder (do not write run outputs there).

## Required artifacts (per run)
All paths below are relative to `projects/<project-name>/artifacts/`.

| File | Owner | Schema |
|------|-------|--------|
| `requirements.json` | product-agent | `schemas/requirements.schema.json` |
| `workplan.json` | planner-agent | `schemas/workplan.schema.json` |
| `architecture.json` | architect-agent | `schemas/architecture.schema.json` |
| `api-contracts.json` | architect-agent | `schemas/api-contracts.schema.json` (OpenAPI 3.x) |
| `data-model.json` | architect-agent | `schemas/data-model.schema.json` |
| `adr/*.json` | architect-agent | `schemas/adr.schema.json` |
| `code_spec.json` | developer-agent | `schemas/code_spec.schema.json` |
| `test_plan.json` | qa-agent | `schemas/test_plan.schema.json` |
| `review_report.json` | reviewer-agent | `schemas/review_report.schema.json` |
| `release_report.json` | devops-agent | `schemas/release_report.schema.json` |
| `e2e_report.json` | e2e-agent | `schemas/e2e_report.schema.json` |
| `workflow_state.json` | orchestrator-agent | `schemas/workflow_state.schema.json` |
| `backlog.json` | orchestrator-agent (monitoring_feedback) | `schemas/backlog.schema.json` |
| `events.log.jsonl` | all agents (append-only) | `schemas/event.schema.json` |

## Stage gates (must pass before advancing)
- `task_decomposition` requires valid `requirements.json`
- `planning_architecture` requires valid `workplan.json`
- `code_generation` requires valid `architecture.json` + `api-contracts.json`
- `code_review` requires valid `code_spec.json`; a `rejected` verdict triggers a bounded
  review→fix rework loop (re-dispatches the developer subtree, `max_rework` default 2) —
  it never advances to QA/deploy
- `testing_validation` requires valid `code_spec.json` (planner orders it **after** `code_review`)
- `deployment` requires `review_report.json` verdict ∈ {approved, approved_with_comments} AND `test_plan.json` summary.failed == 0
- `e2e_validation` (UI projects only) requires valid `e2e_report.json` with verdict ∈
  {passed, passed_with_warnings} AND summary.failed == 0; a `failed` verdict triggers a
  bounded developer rework loop **capped at one round** (post-deploy re-runs are
  expensive), then escalates and queues the failure to `backlog.json`
- `monitoring_feedback` is a feedback loop, not a blocking gate (SPEC §3.9): a healthy deploy
  completes the run; an unhealthy deploy queues a `backlog.json` item and, when enabled
  (`--feedback-loop N` / `max_feedback_cycles > 0`), runs a bounded two-level remediation loop —
  Level 1 in-run health rework (cap 1), then up to N Level-2 cross-run re-plans (the product agent
  folds the backlog into updated requirements) — each re-deploy still honours `production_deploy`,
  then escalates. Default (0) keeps the one-shot signal.

## Workflow Reference
The agentic loop diagram is at `workflow/mermaid.md`. All agents should use it as the authoritative visual reference for stage sequence, ownership, and escalation paths.

## Event log format
Every agent appends one JSONL event on completion. Fields: event_id (uuid), workflow_id, stage, agent, status (success|failure|blocked|retry), input_refs[], output_refs[], summary, blocking_issues[], retry_count, timestamp (ISO 8601).
