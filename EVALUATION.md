## 1. TL;DR

**The deterministic control plane is the core of the submission, and the NEURAL
SYNC demo now runs end-to-end to `complete`.**

The orchestrator (`src/orchestrator/engine.py`) is genuinely good: deterministic,
event-sourced, atomically persisted, DAG-scheduled with per-task retry/rework/escalate,
and least-privilege + model-diverse by role. It matches the brief's *"determinism >
creativity, orchestration > model intelligence"* constraint.

The recorded end-to-end demo (`neural-sync`) produced **all** artifacts, a **green QA
suite (108/108 today; 77/77 at the original recorded run)**, and reaches
`current_stage: "complete"` with every stage gate
satisfied (`workflow_state.json`). Along the way the **review gate caught a real
contract defect (BLK-001)** — the deploy gate correctly refused to ship while the
review verdict was `rejected`. The defect was fixed, the reviewer re-approved
(`verdict: approved_with_comments`, 0 open issues), and the **deployment stage was
re-run and passed**: `release_report.json` verdict `success`, the app live in a
hardened local Docker container with a passing HTTP health check.

Net: the factory built a substantial app, **caught its own defect at the review gate**,
and shipped only after it was resolved — the gates are load-bearing, not decorative.

## 2. What worked

### 2.1 Deterministic, recoverable control plane
- **Atomic state + event sourcing.** `_persist` writes temp + renames; `_event` stamps
  `event_id`/`timestamp` so the audit log can't be fabricated (`engine.py`). State is
  reconstructable by folding `events.log.jsonl` (`SPEC.md §8.1`).
- **Transient-failure recovery actually fired.** The demo log shows the developer agent
  and the QA agent each hit the 1800 s wall-clock timeout and **recover on re-dispatch**
  (`events.log.jsonl`; `workflow_state.json` attempt counters). This is real evidence
  for success-criterion 4.3 (recover from simulated failures), for the transient class.
- **Self-healing artifact generation.** `code_review` retried twice on a
  missing/malformed `review_report.json` (invalid JSON) and then succeeded — the gate
  caught bad output mechanically rather than passing it downstream.

### 2.2 Schema-gated, structured handoffs
Every required artifact is present and schema-valid in
`projects/neural-sync/artifacts/`: `requirements`, `workplan`, `architecture`,
`api-contracts` (~84 KB), `data-model` (~88 KB), 4 ADRs, `code_spec`, `test_plan`,
`review_report`, `release_report`, `workflow_state`, `events.log.jsonl`. No stage
advanced on free-form prose.

### 2.3 QA was green and traceable
`test_plan.json` → `summary: { total: 108, passed: 108, failed: 0, skipped: 0 }`
(108 today; 77 at the original recorded run), with
**all 13 acceptance criteria (AC1–AC13) covered by ≥1 test**, including the two
signature cases from the idea brief: good-match score ≥ 0.75 (TC-001) and the skill-only
**trap** bad-match score ≤ 0.45 (TC-002). The behavioral layer demonstrably changes the
verdict — the system is *not* skill-only.

### 2.4 The review gate did its job
The reviewer caught a genuine, runtime-breaking defect (BLK-001, below) — not a nitpick.
A weaker pipeline would have shipped it. The `opus` reviewer being a *stronger, different*
model than the `sonnet` developer (`SPEC.md §4`) is exactly the echo-chamber break that
surfaced it.

### 2.5 The deploy gate + monitoring closed cleanly
Once the review verdict was `approved_with_comments` and tests were `failed == 0`, the
deploy gate (`_deploy_gate`, `engine.py:744`) passed and the DevOps path produced a
**healthy local deployment** (`release_report.json` verdict `success`; live URL; HTTP
health check `pass`). The post-deploy `_monitor` pass then folded a **"deploy healthy"**
signal (`monitoring_feedback / success`) — the closed-loop Stage-8 fold working as
specified (`SPEC.md §3.9`).

---

## 3. What the gates caught — and how it was resolved (recovery in action)

### 3.1 BLK-001 — the defect the review gate caught
The reviewer flagged one blocking issue (`review_report.json`, originally
`verdict: "rejected"`):

> **BLK-001 (contract_violation):** `GET /teams/{team_id}/risk-summary` returned HTTP 501
> Not Implemented instead of the contracted 200 + `TeamRiskSummary`. The Manager dashboard
> calls `getTeamRiskSummary(teamId)` and would render the error state — **AC8 (manager
> risk badges) non-functional at runtime.**

The deploy gate behaved correctly: with the review `rejected`, `release_report.json`
recorded `verdict: "failed"` and **no image was built** — the factory refused to ship code
the reviewer rejected (`SPEC.md §7`, `_deploy_gate`).

**Resolution:** the endpoint was implemented (`src/api/feedback.py` —
`get_team_risk_summary` now computes per-developer burnout/bench badges and returns
`TeamRiskSummary`; no `501` remains anywhere in `src/`). The reviewer re-evaluated and
re-approved (`verdict: approved_with_comments`, 0 blocking issues). N16 is now functional.

### 3.2 Transient-failure recovery
The developer and QA agents each hit the 1800 s timeout and recovered on re-dispatch
(`events.log.jsonl`) — recovery from the transient failure class, demonstrated twice.

### 3.3 The deploy stage re-run → `complete`
With BLK-001 fixed and the review approved, the **deployment stage was re-executed through
the engine** (operator-triggered retry — the same `--retry` / re-dispatch recovery path
the engine provides; `unblock`, `engine.py:341`). The deploy gate passed, the DevOps path
built and ran the container, the health check passed, and the engine recorded
`deployment / success` → `monitoring_feedback / success`, finalizing
`current_stage: "complete"`. A deterministic `--replay` re-validates all 10 tasks green.

## 4. The engine's recovery machinery (why the halt was never a dead end)

The control plane already contains the mechanisms that make a caught defect a *closeable*
event rather than a terminal one:

- **Bounded review→fix rework loop** — `_request_rework` / `_drain_rework` /
  `_apply_rework` (`engine.py:578–631`): a `rejected` verdict resets the developer
  subtree with the `blocking_issues` as feedback, up to `max_rework` (default 2), then
  escalates. Wired into the wave loop at `engine.py:442`.
- **Verdict gate at `code_review`** — `_review_gate` (`engine.py:712`) returns `rework`
  on `rejected` *at the review stage*, before QA/deploy, so rejected code no longer burns
  a QA cycle (`SPEC.md §3.5/§7/§8.3`).
- **Operator recovery** — `unblock` (`engine.py:341`) resets a stuck stage to `pending`
  and clears the halt so the workflow re-dispatches after the cause is fixed; this is the
  path used to re-run deployment here.
- **Post-deploy `e2e_validation` stage** — `_e2e_gate` (`engine.py:770`): the `e2e-agent`
  drives the *deployed* UI in a real browser via Playwright MCP and gates on
  `e2e_report.json`; a `failed` verdict feeds the same bounded rework loop, capped at one
  round (`STAGE_REWORK_CAP['e2e_validation']`). Implemented; see Known limitations below.

## 5. Scorecard vs. hackathon success criteria

| Criterion | Verdict | Basis |
|-----------|:------:|-------|
| ≥80% of runs without human intervention | ✅ | Run reaches `complete`; human input only at the **3 designed checkpoints** (requirements, architecture, `production_deploy` — `HUMAN_GATES`). Engine also supports fully unattended `--yes` runs |
| Artifacts consistent (QA tests pass) | ✅ | 108/108 pass (77 at the recorded run), all AC covered; all artifacts schema-valid |
| Recover from ≥2 simulated failures | ✅ | Transient timeouts recovered twice (§3.2); the review gate caught BLK-001 and the run closed it and re-deployed (§3.1/§3.3) |
| Re-run with modified requirements | ✅ | `workflow_id`-keyed runs; product update mode; `--replay` re-validation |

**Cost & Efficiency (scorecard §7):** per-role spend is auto-collected from the event log into
`artifacts/cost_report.{json,md}` (`--cost-report`; recorded run **$16.51** / 16.2M tok / 5611s),
models are routed per role (opus/sonnet/haiku, `SPEC.md §4`), and a live model A/B
(`scripts/cost_ab_experiment.py`) shows a cheap model is good enough for log summarization. Full
write-up → [`COST-EFFICIENCY.md`](COST-EFFICIENCY.md).

## 6. Known limitations / next (highest leverage first)

Stated plainly — a clear-eyed limits list is part of an honest evaluation:

1. **`e2e_validation` not yet exercised on the demo.** The browser stage is implemented
   and the app is now live (a full Docker Compose stack serves the React UI); driving it
   end-to-end through the `e2e-agent` + Playwright MCP and emitting `e2e_report.json` is
   the immediate next step.
2. **Fully-unattended single-pass run.** The demo used the designed `production_deploy`
   human checkpoint and an operator retry of the deploy stage after the fix; a clean
   single `--yes` pass with no operator touch is supported and worth recording.
3. **Embeddings/ANN path (N6).** Embeddings are written lazily; the semantic-similarity /
   pgvector HNSW path is present but not fully exercised — wire embedding-on-write to make
   it real.
4. **Smaller items:** Admin page (N15) is API-only; logout doesn't revoke the 7-day
   refresh cookie (NBI-005); Git/PR + CI automation (stretch S2.d) is not implemented
   (deploy is local Docker).

---

## 7. Honesty statement

The orchestrator design is the strongest part of this submission and stands on its own.
The demo is real and **now completes end-to-end**: the factory built a substantial app
through review and QA, the review gate caught a genuine contract defect, and the app
deploys to a healthy local container **only after** that defect was fixed. We deliberately
keep the full event history — including the earlier deploy-gate blocks — in the
append-only `events.log.jsonl`: the recovery is part of the story, not hidden. What
remains is breadth (exercise the browser-validation stage, one clean unattended pass),
not a missing capability.

## 8. Post-audit compliance pass — `feat/task04-compliance` branch

After the run above, a Task-04 re-audit found real gaps; a compliance pass closed them — hardening
both the demo app **and** the factory. Full file-level status:
`projects/neural-sync/docs/TASK04-COMPLIANCE.md`.

**What was added (test suite 108 → 243 green):**
- **pgvector ANN made load-bearing** — previously decorative (no ANN query existed). Now
  `engine/retrieval.py` powers `POST /developers/{id}/recommendations` + `/similar`; the
  deterministic scorer is untouched, so the matching ACs still hold. Verified live against pgvector.
- **Real re-optimization** — `rescore`/`reembed`/`risk-refresh` were stubs returning a fake job_id;
  now real (`services/reoptimization.py`) + an opt-in APScheduler loop. Closes the §10 "static
  allocation" failure condition.
- **Data ingestion (§5)** — `src/connectors/` (live GitLab + HR/Slack/CV file + Jira adapter) feeding
  the existing enrichment+embedding path; `/ingestion/*` endpoints + UI.
- **Roles aligned to §6** — real `admin` role (migration 003); weight tuning + system-override
  allocations are Admin-only (were manager-only / missing); paginated 10k roster + roster UI.
- **Scale proven, not claimed** — `scripts/seed_scale.py` + k6 harness; **measured** p95 at 10,050
  developers: roster 39ms, ANN /similar 321ms (all < 500ms) —
  `projects/neural-sync/artifacts/perf/load_test_report.md`.

**Factory upgrade — safe brownfield extension.** The most reusable outcome: the engine gained a
non-destructive `--feature` mode (`SPEC.md` §8.7). The ingestion subsystem (WS-D) was built **by the
factory** as an incremental feature on the already-complete project — additive workplan, existing
code untouched, review approved, QA green. The factory proving it can *evolve* a live codebase, not
only scaffold a new one.

**Honest limitations (carried + new):**
- The WS-D pipeline's **deploy + e2e were sandbox-limited** (agent `docker build` blocked; Playwright
  MCP not granted) — verified instead by 106 backend/integration tests + live in the dev container
  (`/api/v1/ingestion/*` respond); a real deploy + browser e2e must be re-run in a Docker+Playwright
  environment. The regenerated multi-stage `Dockerfile` is **unbuilt/unverified**.
- Deliberate deviations stand: **Gemini** (not Claude) for the app LLM; **pgvector** (not
  Pinecone/Weaviate); Slack/Jira/HR are file-import + credential-gated adapters (live OAuth is roadmap).
- The branch is **not merged to `main`**.
